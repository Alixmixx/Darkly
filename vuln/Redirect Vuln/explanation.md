**Vulnerability Type: Open Redirect**

**Explanation of the Exercise:**
In the provided scenario, the web application has a redirect functionality implemented through a "redirect" parameter in the URL. The vulnerability arises when an attacker manipulates this parameter to redirect users to a malicious site. In this case, the redirection is achieved by setting the "site" parameter to "malicious_site" in the URL.

**Impact:**
The impact of an open redirect vulnerability is significant. Attackers can exploit this to trick users into visiting malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks, the delivery of malware, or other forms of exploitation. In the context of the exercise, the attacker is able to obtain a flag by redirecting the user to a crafted page that displays the flag.

**Demonstration to Avoid the Problem:**
To mitigate the open redirect vulnerability, developers should implement proper input validation and sanitize user-controlled input. Here are some steps to avoid this problem:

1. **Input Validation:** Ensure that the input values for redirection, such as the "site" parameter in this case, are validated against an expected list of safe values. If the input does not match the expected values, the redirection should not be allowed.

2. **Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed redirection URLs. Only allow redirects to URLs on this whitelist to prevent attackers from redirecting users to arbitrary, potentially malicious sites.

3. **Use a Safe Redirect Function:** If possible, use a secure redirect function provided by the framework or programming language being used. This function should handle redirects safely, ensuring that the destination is a trusted and validated URL.

**Impact of Breach:**
If this vulnerability is exploited, it could lead to various consequences, such as users unknowingly visiting malicious sites, potential theft of sensitive information through phishing attacks, or the delivery of malware to the user's device.

In summary, it is crucial for developers to validate and sanitize user input, especially when it involves redirection, to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities and protect users from potential security threats.
