We tried investigating the password recover page. After some tries with burp repeater to find a parameter to change,
We found in the returned web page an hidden input:

    <form action="#" method="POST">
        <input type="hidden" name="mail" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">
        <input type="submit" name="Submit" value= "Submit">
    </form>

Going back to the page, we are able to inspect the site, and remove the hidden input
After typing admin inside it, we get the flag (lol)

 The flag is : 1d4855f7337c0c14b6f44946872c4eb33853f40b2d54393fbe94f49f1e19bbb0
