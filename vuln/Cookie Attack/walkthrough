When investigating the site in the inspect section, we found some cookie:

I_am_admin:"68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327"

We quickly found that the hash is md5 encrypted, and it is actualy "false"

I tried to encode true in md5, and it gave me a victory message:

Good job! Flag : df2eb4ba34ed059a1e3e89ff4dfc13445f104a1a52295214def1c4fb1693a5c3
