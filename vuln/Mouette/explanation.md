**Vulnerability Type: Open Redirect**

**Explanation of Exercise:**
In this exercise, the objective is to exploit an open redirect vulnerability. The application allows users to navigate to different pages by providing a parameter in the URL (`index.php?page=`). The vulnerability arises because the application does not properly validate or restrict the redirect destination. An attacker can manipulate the redirect URL to point to arbitrary domains, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.

**Demonstration to Avoid the Problem:**
To mitigate the open redirect vulnerability, the application should validate and restrict the redirect destination to only trusted domains. Additionally, it's essential to implement proper input validation and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks. For instance, instead of directly using the provided URL parameter, the application should validate that it corresponds to an expected and trusted destination.

Here's a modified request that avoids the vulnerability:

```
GET /index.php?page=trusted_page HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.16
User-Agent: ft_bornToSec
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

Connection: close

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

**Impact of the Breach:**
If this open redirect vulnerability is exploited, an attacker could craft malicious URLs to redirect users to phishing sites, where sensitive information such as login credentials could be stolen. In this specific exercise, the attacker is instructed to use a specific browser (`ft_bornToSec`) and to appear as if they are coming from `https://www.nsa.gov/`. This could potentially lead to users trusting the redirected page, thinking it is a legitimate NSA site, when in fact, it's controlled by the attacker.

In the provided example, the flag `albatroz` is obtained as a result of successful exploitation, indicating that an unauthorized user has manipulated the redirect to achieve their goals.
